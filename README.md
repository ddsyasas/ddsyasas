About Me 👨‍💻

🚀 Coding for Research and Innovation
I am a Physics Scholar with a passion for Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics Research and Digital Innovation. My coding journey stems from two major passions:

Physics Research:

Developing and utilizing computational tools to solve complex problems in Condensed-Matter Physics.
Coding in Python, MATLAB, C, and C++ for simulations, data analysis, and modeling.
Exploring innovative approaches to material-based sensors and other physics-related breakthroughs using computational techniques.

Software Development for Real-World Impact:

As the founder of IDER Solutions, I lead a team dedicated to building in-house software products, web apps, and mobile applications.
Our focus is on solving real-world problems through technology, from tools for productivity to platforms for digital growth.
My tech stack includes JavaScript, Node.js, React, HTML/CSS, and SQL for full-stack development.

💡 Why Coding?
Coding is the bridge between theoretical understanding and practical application. For me, it’s not just about writing code but about creating solutions—whether it’s optimizing research workflows or building tools that make people’s lives easier.

🌐 What I Bring to the Table:

Physics meets Technology: Leveraging advanced research methodologies with programming to tackle challenges in science and industry.
Full-Stack Development: Proficient in creating scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications tailored to specific needs.
Problem-Solving Focus: Driven by curiosity, I continuously develop tools that address gaps in everyday life and research.
